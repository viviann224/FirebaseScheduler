# Firebase Train Scheduler

**GETTING STARTED**:
The program should run automatically.

If the program is not running automatically, please make sure you have all the prerequisites listed below.

**STATEMENT OF PURPOSE**:
Learn how to store and get data via Firebase Database, using the useful moment.js to calculate time, and testing user input via submission of a form.

Once the user submits a valid request the new train schedule autopopulates.

Firebase Train Scheduler was created to showcase the use of Firebase, Moment.js, jQuery, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML skills to provide a train scheduler for the user to enjoy dynamic visual interaction when clicked.

**PREREQUISITES**:
- Google Chrome Internet Browser
-jQuery enabled on Google Chrome
- JavaScript enabled on Google Chrome
- Access to Google Font packages
- CDN support on Bootstrap
- Perfered viewing in English language :us:

**HOW TO PLAY**:
Once pages loads, the user will input values for the Train Name, Destination, First Train Time, and Frequency.

Once the user completes the input files, click submit. The form checks if the frequency, and first train time is valid, if valid, the information is stored into the firebase database. If the user submits an invalid entry, an alert will pop up telling the user to try again.

The program then checks the firebase database to see if there is a new entry stored, if so, the user submission will be displayed on the Current Train Schedule.
